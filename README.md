# Razum is a react built web app for creators and founders to learn from each other's fuckups and connect

This is a React (Custom Hooks, Context) web app, made with Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the
following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. 
These four different pages, we have both public and private ones that uses auth listeners. 
Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

The main functionality of this app is to solve a knowledge problem which is core to the everyday activities 
of startup founders. Founders come and share their daily struggles and lessons in the form of fuckups 
with other founders who are at the same stage to learn and take better actions. 
Majority of fuckups on the web are about mature companies and hardly relevant. 
That's where Razum comes in as a place for makers to learn together and take smarter routes.
