
## Learning to code

I started learning web design and development around 2017 I learned HTML5 and CSS3 and started to build brochure websites for customers.

I'm currently working on releasing some of the outstanding work for my portfolio. 

## Projects due for release 

1. A React app with custom hooks and Tailwind CSS. [Razum web app](https://razum.vercel.app).

*I built the app by following an online tutorial, and as a result,  I cannot reproduce some of the features by myself because I'm still learning Javascript fundamentals. My aim with this app was to familiarize myself with Tailwind CSS. The site is responsive and makes use of firebase auth, however, it's not working because the firebase rules need to be updated.*

2. A React site with Tailwind CSS [Addin Flux web app](https://dancing-concha-ca2fa0.netlify.app/).
*I'm currently working on this site for my portfolio, it's not yet completed. The buttons are not yet functional and it's not responsive*

## A finished flutter android and ios app
